			<p>I like lists! I think they’re easier to digest than paragraphs so here are the top five things I’d like you to know about me:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>1</h3> My experience is in Digital Design, with a strong focus on experience design. I like to collaborate and have loved working on projects at Topshop and Harvey Nichols where 3rd party partners integrated different functionalities onto e-commerce sites, but where the design was done in-house by me.</li>

				<li><h3>2</h3> I have a user-focused design mentality and love solving design problems. I can design and develop simple user experiences that integrate in shopping experiences without being disruptive. I create graphic content flows that don’t follow previous templates and love working out unique solutions to each problem I come across.</li>

				<li><h3>3</h3> I am confident leading teams, mentoring junior team members and working across various departments such as PR and Marketing. I make strategies come to life, helping my team to deliver great work. It’s one of my favourite things about my job!</li>

				<li><h3>4</h3> I understand sometimes the smallest jobs can have the biggest impact. I work hard to deliver small digital marketing products (such as ad’s) with the same enthusiasm as juicy big campaigns.</li>

				<li><h3>5</h3> I have experience pitching my strategies and ideas. I have presented in winning pitch presentations, spoken at brand conferences and had my team’s work featured in industry publications such as ‘Creative Review’.</li>

				<li><h3>5+ (bonus)</h3> I genuinely love fashion, branding and am always searching for innovative ways of thinking. It’s something that’s a hobby for me! Case in point: while living in Los Angeles for three months I am taking a front-end web development course because increasingly there is a need for digital designers to code and work closely with coders to speed up processes.</li>
